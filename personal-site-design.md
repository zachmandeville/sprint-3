# Personal Site Design

## What's your Site's Primary Purpose?
To act as a portfolio for now, but really to be a stopgap example for using CSS grid designs.  This will not be the final site.

## Who Is your Target Audience?
Right now, the teachers at EDA.  I can use the skills here to build up a full portfolio page though.

## How do you want visitors to interact with the site?  What experience do you want them to have?
I want it to be very simple, and lead them to the largest part of the site right now, the blog.  I don't want it to be busy, with clear navigation to the next section of the site.  I want the blogs easy to navigate and read, too.

## How would you build the site to support this experience?
I would not overthink the design and I'd make the site simple, with big buttons.
